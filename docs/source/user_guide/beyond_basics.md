# Beyond the Basics

This section dives into PyTorch's advanced functionalities, empowering developers
to optimize and extend their machine learning models. It explores `torch.export` for
exporting models, `torch.compile` for performance enhancement, distributed training
for scaling, and quantization for reducing model size and improving inference speed.
Profiling tools are discussed for performance optimization, and custom operators and
extensions are covered to tailor PyTorch to specific needs. This guide is for those
ready to move beyond the basics and leverage PyTorch's full potential.
