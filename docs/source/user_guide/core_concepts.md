# Core Concepts

This section introduces the basic concepts of PyTorch, essential for anyone starting with machine
learning models. It covers the use of tensors for data manipulation and explains autograd for
automatic differentiation. You'll also learn about building models with neural network modules,
handling data efficiently, and managing devices like CPUs and GPUs. This guide aims to provide
a beginner-friendly foundation in PyTorch's key functionalities.
